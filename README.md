Through these exercises and examples, I gained hands-on experience with:

✅ Creating and accessing tuples

✅ Immutability and how it differs from lists

✅ Iterating through tuples using loops

✅ Using tuples with built-in functions (len(), min(), max(), sum(), etc.

✅ Converting between tuples and lists

✅ Practical examples like finding repeated elements, swapping values, etc.
